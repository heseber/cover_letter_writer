    === YOUR TASK ===
    Your task is to create a compelling cover letter that:
    1. Addresses the specific requirements mentioned in the job description
    2. Highlights the most relevant qualifications from the candidate's documents
    3. Demonstrates clear alignment between the candidate's experience and the job requirements
    4. Uses a professional yet personable tone
    5. Is well-structured with clear paragraphs (introduction, body, conclusion)
    6. Incorporates any reviewer feedback provided to improve the draft
    
    The cover letter should be persuasive and make a strong case for why this 
    candidate is an excellent fit for the position.

    === IMPORTANT REQUIREMENTS ===
    - You MUST FOLLOW the reviewer's feedback to improve the draft.
    - You MUST REMOVE any expertise mentioned in the cover letter that is not supported by the candidate's documents.

    === DETAILED WRITING GUIDELINES ===
    Write the following text so that it is truly indistinguishable from human writing,
    consciously avoiding every typical marker of AI-generated content.
    
    In particular:

    - You MUST NOT use any em-dashes or en-dashes.

    - Vary punctuation in a way that reflects genuine human habits.

    - Do not default to lists of exactly three items; include lists with any number of items 
      (two, four, five, etc.), and sometimes avoid lists altogether.
        
    - Vary the length and structure of sentences and paragraphs to create a natural, irregular
      rhythm instead of uniform blocks.
        
    - Use transitions and linking words (such as "However," "Additionally," or "On the other hand")
      with moderation, and do not begin each paragraph with stock transitions.
        
    - Avoid repetitive phrasing, mechanically predictable structures, and summarizing points that have
      already been established.
        
    - Incorporate personal anecdotes, real-life examples, subjectively strong opinions, colloquial
      language, or subtle humor when appropriate.
        
    - Occasionally include cultural, regional, or context-dependent references and idioms that would
      signal authentic human experience and audience awareness.
        
    - Do not use robotic or perfectly formal tone throughout—allow for natural changes in register,
      some informality, and the occasional shift in tone or style.
        
    - Avoid overused "AI-sounding" words and expressions, including but not limited to: "robust,"
      "delve," "utilize," "endeavor," "in today's world," "as a matter of fact," "exactly," or
      tricolon patterns ("It does this, this, and this").
        
    - Use specific details and nuanced insights instead of generalizations or generic statements;
      show depth, originality, and lived knowledge.
        
    - Present facts accurately and avoid fabricating details, but allow for occasional subtle
      uncertainty or questioning, as natural in human discourse.
        
    - Adjust punctuation so that it does not follow strict, repetitive, or overly perfect patterns;
      use a mix of punctuation as fits the context.
        
    - Maintain proper grammar and spelling at all times, but do not strive for unrealistic
      flawlessness—natural minor variances are acceptable.
        
    - Create an authentic flow by varying pacing, argument structure, and narrative sequence—do
      not overly optimize for linearity or predictability.
        
    - Double-check that the writing lacks any of the following additional AI clues: uniform structure,
      excessive clarity, flat or neutral tone, absence of context, or abrupt stylistic shifts.

    - Remember, YOU MUST NOT use any em-dashes or en-dashes.

    ---

    Carefully follow these instructions for every sentence, ensuring the writing convincingly mimics
    human style and intuition in all its variety and subtlety.

    Be sure to use a formal style that is appropriate for a job application letter and reflects the
    candidate's years of experience and seniority.

    Return just the cover letter, no other text surrounding it.
